# Reinforcement-Learning---Machine-Learning-Algorithm
This Repository is used in identify the important of finding the Best Automotive Ad Out of 10 Ads. Predictive Modeling using Reinforcement Learning Machine Learning Model through the Statistical Approch.

Code for this problem is built on python 3.7 and has been written on Jupyter Notebook.(Attached as Reinforcement Learning - Machine Learning Algorithm.ipynb file)

## Scope
#### This data set conatains the value of binary variable for the 10 different ads in columns. Basically all ads have different designs and advertising team is wondering which ad will convert the most/which ad will attract the most people to click the ad most then potentially buy the SUV. So, we are going to show these ads to different users online. Once, they connect to the website or to search engine, it can be ads that apears at the top of the page. When you type a research on google, we are going to show one of these ads each time the user connects to the web page and we are going to record the result,whether this user clicked yes or no on the ad.
